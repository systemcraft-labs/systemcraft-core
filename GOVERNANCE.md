# Systemcraft Governance

This document defines the governance principles of Systemcraft-based systems.

Governance in Systemcraft is not about leadership charisma or trust.
It is about **structural clarity**, **explicit authority**, and **risk containment**.

---

## 1. Core Governance Premise

No system is healthy if:
- responsibility is implicit
- authority is emotional
- risk is silently inherited

Systemcraft governance exists to ensure that **no individual becomes the default buffer**  
for ambiguity, conflict, or failure.

---

## 2. Separation of Roles

Systemcraft enforces a strict separation between the following roles:

### 2.1 Authority
The right to decide and direct actions.

- Defines strategy
- Approves execution paths
- Can be delegated
- Must be documented

Authority does **not** automatically imply responsibility.

---

### 2.2 Responsibility
The obligation to execute or manage outcomes.

- Operational execution
- Process management
- Reporting duties

Responsibility does **not** imply risk ownership.

---

### 2.3 Risk
Legal, financial, reputational, and emotional exposure.

- Must be explicitly assigned
- Cannot be assumed implicitly
- Cannot be transferred without consent

Any unassigned risk is considered **a system failure**.

---

## 3. Named Roles (Minimum Set)

Every Systemcraft system must explicitly define:

### 3.1 Designer
- Creates the structure
- Defines boundaries and failure modes
- Holds no operational responsibility by default

The Designer may step away without system collapse.

---

### 3.2 Operator
- Executes within defined authority
- Does not carry undefined risk
- Can exit without guilt or penalty

---

### 3.3 Custodian
- Holds legal or financial responsibility
- Has veto power on risk-related decisions
- Cannot be overridden emotionally

---

## 4. Veto Rights

Any role holding legal or financial exposure has **explicit veto rights**.

A veto:
- requires no justification
- cannot be overridden by urgency
- exists to prevent irreversible harm

Speed never overrides safety.

---

## 5. Decision Documentation

All decisions that affect:
- money
- liability
- ownership
- long-term commitment

must be:
- written
- timestamped
- accessible

Verbal agreements are **non-binding**.

---

## 6. Exit Rules

A system is incomplete if exit is unsafe.

Every Systemcraft system must define:
- voluntary exit paths
- asset and obligation settlement rules
- timeline clarity

No role should remain out of guilt, pressure, or emotional debt.

---

## 7. Conflict Handling

Conflicts are not personal failures.
They are signals of structural ambiguity.

Systemcraft handles conflict by:
- returning to written structure
- enforcing role boundaries
- suspending action when ambiguity exists

Escalation without structure is prohibited.

---

## 8. Authority Freeze

In cases of:
- unresolved conflict
- unclear responsibility
- disputed risk

All authority pauses until:
- roles are clarified
- documentation is updated
- consent is re-established

Silence or fatigue is not consent.

---

## 9. Governance Over Trust

Systemcraft does not rely on trust.
It relies on **verifiable structure**.

Trust may exist.
Structure must exist.

---

## 10. Governance Evolution

Governance is versioned.

Changes require:
- written proposal
- explicit consent from affected roles
- archived decision history

Nothing changes quietly.

---

## Emotional Accountability Protocol (EAP)

EAP (Emotional Accountability Protocol) is a governance-level policy that defines
clear boundaries between authority, responsibility, and accountability.

This system acknowledges that unclear responsibility, invisible emotional labor,
and ambiguous decision authority systematically damage individuals and destabilize systems.

EAP exists to enforce the following principles:

1. No authority may be exercised without explicitly declared responsibility.
2. No responsibility may be assigned without clear decision-making rights.
3. Emotional labor must never be assumed, implied, or silently extracted.
4. Persistent ambiguity constitutes a systemic failure, not an individual weakness.

For the purpose of governance, emotional labor includes (but is not limited to):
- Conflict mediation without mandate
- Repeated reassurance or emotional regulation of others
- Ambiguity cleanup caused by unclear roles or decisions
- Unpaid coordination or expectation management

Any participant holding decision-making power must:

- Explicitly declare their scope of responsibility prior to action
- Accept accountability for downstream impact within that scope
- Refrain from transferring emotional, cognitive, or structural burden onto others

Failure to meet these conditions results in suspension of decision authority
until responsibility and scope are clearly re-declared.

### Enforcement

In the event of dispute, ambiguity, or perceived burden transfer:

- Maintainers or the designated Governance Council may invoke a temporary veto
- Decision authority remains suspended until scope and responsibility are clarified
- No execution may proceed under unresolved ambiguity

This protocol applies to all governance layers, including but not limited to:
founders, maintainers, operators, contributors, moderators, and delegated leaders.

EAP is non-negotiable and overrides informal hierarchy, urgency-based pressure,
or implied expectations.




**A system that requires sacrifice is broken.  
A system that requires silence is dangerous.  
Systemcraft exists so that no one has to carry what was never theirs.**
