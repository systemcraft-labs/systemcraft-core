## Responsibility & Authority Declaration Protocol

Systemcraft does not operate on goodwill, sacrifice, or assumed trust.  
Systemcraft operates **only on explicitly declared responsibility**.

This document exists to prevent:
- Responsibility overflow  
- Role erosion  
- Emotional exploitation  
- Silent delegation

No individual — architect, operator, contributor, or leader —  
is expected to carry responsibility that is not formally declared.

---

## 1. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1.1 Responsibility Is Never Automatic
Responsibility does **not** arise from:
- Competence
- Longevity
- Urgency
- Moral pressure
- “Because you’re good at it”

👉 **Responsibility exists only through prior declaration.**

---

### 1.2 No Responsibility Without Authority  
### No Authority Without Responsibility

- Responsibility without authority = exploitation  
- Authority without responsibility = coercion  

In Systemcraft, **authority, responsibility, and scope must always be bound in the same declaration**.

---

### 1.3 Emotional Expectation Is Not Responsibility

The following statements never constitute responsibility:
- “You’re the leader”
- “You’re the most capable”
- “I thought you would handle it”
- “This is urgent”

These are **system violation signals**, not obligations.

---

## 2. Responsibility Declaration Structure

Every valid responsibility declaration must include **all six elements below**.

### 2.1 Responsibility Holder  
The individual or entity assuming responsibility.

### 2.2 Scope  
- What is included  
- What is explicitly excluded  

### 2.3 Authority  
- Decision rights  
- Veto rights  
- Delegation permissions  

### 2.4 Duration  
- Start date  
- End date  
- Automatic renewal (default: ❌ none)

### 2.5 Cost & Compensation  
- Time  
- Emotional labor  
- Financial risk  
- Explicit compensation or explicit “no compensation”

### 2.6 Exit Conditions  
- Completion conditions  
- Early termination rules  

👉 **If any of these six are missing, responsibility is invalid.**
