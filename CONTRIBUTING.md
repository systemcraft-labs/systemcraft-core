## Contribution Guidelines for Systemcraft

Systemcraft is a **documentation-first system architecture framework**.  
Contributions are evaluated on **clarity, structure, and boundary integrity** — not enthusiasm or volume.

This document defines how to contribute without introducing ambiguity, pressure, or hidden responsibility.

---

## 1. What This Repository Accepts

We welcome contributions that improve:

- Structural clarity
- Governance logic
- Responsibility boundaries
- Role definitions
- Documentation precision
- Failure-mode analysis

This repository is **not** a place for:
- Motivational writing
- Personal storytelling
- Emotional validation
- Ideological debate
- Token, NFT, or fundraising proposals

---

## 2. Documentation-First Rule

All contributions must be **document-based**.

- No undocumented changes
- No “we’ll formalize later”
- No verbal agreements
- No implied intent

If it’s not written, it doesn’t exist.

---

## 3. Contribution Types

### 3.1 Allowed
- Text improvements (clarity, grammar, precision)
- Structural refinements
- New protocol documents
- Explicit role or responsibility definitions
- Edge-case and failure scenario documentation

### 3.2 Restricted
- Changes to governance logic
- Changes affecting authority, risk, or responsibility
- Removal of safeguards (veto, exit, freeze mechanisms)

Restricted changes require:
- Explicit proposal
- Rationale
- Impact analysis
- Maintainer approval

---

## 4. Proposal Process (Required for Structural Changes)

For any non-trivial change:

1. Open an Issue with:
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed change
   - Affected documents
   - Risk analysis

2. Wait for acknowledgment before submitting a PR.

3. Submit PR with:
   - Clear diff
   - No mixed concerns
   - Documentation updates included

---

## 5. Responsibility Boundary Rule

No contribution may:
- Implicitly expand someone’s responsibility
- Shift risk without consent
- Introduce moral pressure or urgency framing

If a proposal relies on phrases like:
- “Someone should handle…”
- “It would be good if…”
- “In urgent cases…”

It will be rejected.

---

## 6. Tone & Language Requirements

- Neutral
- Precise
- Non-accusatory
- Non-emotional
- System-oriented

Avoid:
- Personal judgments
- Psychological labeling
- Hero narratives
- Blame framing

Systemcraft documents describe **systems**, not people.

---

## 7. Versioning & Traceability

- Each PR must address **one concern only**
- Changes must be reversible
- Rationale must be preserved in commit history

Nothing changes quietly.

---

## 8. Dispute Handling

Disputes are handled by:
1. Returning to written structure
2. Clarifying scope and authority
3. Freezing changes if ambiguity persists

Escalation through emotion, volume, or persistence is prohibited.

---

## 9. Maintainer Authority

Maintainers may:
- Request rewrites
- Reject contributions without justification
- Freeze discussions

This is not punitive.  
It is structural protection.

---

## 10. Final Note

Systemcraft values:
- Clear thinking over speed
- Boundaries over goodwill
- Safety over consensus

If a contribution makes the system harder to exit,
harder to understand,
or easier to exploit —

it does not belong here.
