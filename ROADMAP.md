# Systemcraft Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the staged development of Systemcraft as a
governance-first system design framework.

The goal is not rapid growth, but structural correctness, durability,
and global applicability across organizations, DAOs, and distributed systems.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation (Completed)

**Objective:** Establish non-negotiable principles and governance constraints.

- Core philosophy defined in MANIFESTO
- Governance structure formalized in GOVERNANCE
- Emotional Accountability Protocol (EAP) embedded as a system safeguard
- Repository positioned as a system design framework, not a product

Outcome:
A stable ideological and governance foundation resistant to scope creep,
authority abuse, and invisible labor extraction.

---

## Phase 1 — Structural Clarity

**Objective:** Make responsibility and authority explicit and auditable.

- Introduce responsibility and scope declaration standards
- Define decision-right boundaries for all roles
- Publish templates for responsibility declaration and delegation
- Clarify veto, suspension, and escalation mechanics

Outcome:
Decisions become traceable.
Responsibility can no longer be implicitly transferred or obscured.

---

## Phase 2 — Protocolization

**Objective:** Separate principles into reusable governance modules.

- Extract EAP into a standalone protocol document
- Modularize governance rules for reuse across systems
- Define minimum governance requirements for adoption
- Enable external referencing without dependency on Systemcraft branding

Outcome:
Systemcraft governance principles become portable and composable.

---

## Phase 3 — Applied Systems

**Objective:** Validate Systemcraft through real-world application.

- Apply governance framework to pilot projects (DAO, open-source, organizations)
- Observe failure points and governance stress cases
- Refine protocols based on operational feedback
- Document case studies without personal narratives

Outcome:
Theory is pressure-tested.
Governance failures are treated as system bugs, not human flaws.

---

## Phase 4 — Ecosystem Expansion

**Objective:** Enable third-party adoption and contribution.

- Support forks and derivative governance systems
- Define compatibility standards
- Establish contributor and maintainer pathways
- Prevent dilution of core governance principles

Outcome:
Systemcraft evolves into an ecosystem without losing structural integrity.

---

## Phase 5 — Long-Term Stewardship

**Objective:** Ensure longevity beyond original authorship.

- Transition from founder-centric control to steward-based governance
- Formalize succession and delegation models
- Preserve protocol integrity over time
- Resist trend-driven or market-driven erosion

Outcome:
Systemcraft remains stable, legible, and enforceable over decades.

---

## Guiding Constraint

Progression between phases is not time-based.

Advancement occurs only when:
- Responsibility is explicit
- Authority is bounded
- Accountability is enforceable
- Emotional and structural exploitation is structurally blocked

Systemcraft prioritizes correctness over speed.
