## Role Definition & Boundary Templates

This document defines the mandatory role templates used in all Systemcraft-based systems.

Roles in Systemcraft are **not titles**.  
They are **explicit contracts of authority, responsibility, and risk**.

No role exists without boundaries.  
No individual may occupy a role without explicit declaration.

---

## 1. Core Rule

Every participant must occupy **at least one** clearly defined role.  
No participant may operate outside declared roles.

Unassigned behavior is considered **out-of-system**.

---

## 2. Architect (System Designer)

### Authority

- Day-to-day management
- Financial handling
- Emotional mediation

### Risk
- None by default

### Exit
The Architect may exit at any time without system collapse.

## 7. Role Stacking Rules

- Each role must be independently documented
- Role conflict must be resolved structurally, not emotionally

---

## 8. Role Violation Protocol

A violation occurs when:
- A role performs excluded actions
- Responsibility expands without declaration
- Risk is transferred implicitly

Violations trigger:

- Possible role revocation
